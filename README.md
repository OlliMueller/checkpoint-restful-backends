# Checkpoint Restful Backends

You will rebuild the suggested contacts widget of LinkedIn.

- Use this API: https://dummy-apis.netlify.app/api/contact-suggestions?count=1
- Show 8 suggested contacts by default
- If you click the close / remove button on a suggested contact the contact is removed and ad new suggestion is added to the end of the suggestion panel
- The connect feature should be (dummy) implemented (you do not actually connect with anyone) in the browser - no api calls required
- The number of pending requests should be persisted between browser sessions
- If you click the "Connect" button the number of pending invitation changes and the text of the button changes to "Pending"
- If you click the "Pending" button it should switch back to "Connect" and the number of pending invitations should be decreased
- While LinkedIn shows the number of connections OR the company name you should always show the number of mutual connections

## Development Process

- Create a new repository (name = checkpoint-restful-backends) for the checkpoint task (locally and on GitHub)
- Make an initial commit with a README.md on the main branch
- Make all other commits on a new branch called checkpoint
- Use semantic commits
- Push all your code to GitHub
- Create a new pull request when your are done that will merge your checkpoint branch into the main branch
- Do not merge the branch yourself
- Assign the codingbootcampseu GitHub user read permission to your repo
- Assign the codingbootcampseu user as reviewer to your pull request
